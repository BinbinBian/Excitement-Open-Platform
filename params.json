{"name":"Excitement-open-platform","tagline":"Open Source Platform for Recognizing Textual Entailments (RTE)","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nExcitement Open Platform (EOP) is an open source software platform containing state-of-the-art algorithms for recognizing entailment relations between two portions of text: given two text fragments, one named text and the other named hypothesis, the task consists in recognizing whether the hypothesis can be inferred from the text. Written in Java, EOP is a main product of the Excitement project. EOP's architecture is designed to be efficient and extendable. Highlights include:\r\n\r\n- Separation between Linguistic Analysis Pipelines and Entailment Components\r\n- Supporting modularity and interoperability among Components\r\n- Java API with source code\r\n- Detailed documentation to understand the structure and implementation of EOP\r\n- Pretrained multi-lingual models (i.e. English, German, Italian)\r\n- Trainable with new sample data\r\n\r\nReferences: S.

Users can have access to the last code release by selecting the _Last Release_ option at the right side menu. In contrast developers who wants to contribute to the project have to select the _EOP Repository_ option from the menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Get Involved\r\n\r\nThe EOP platform is developed by the members of the Excitement project and by volunteers and is always looking for new contributors to work on all parts of the project. Every contribution is welcome and can be anything from a small documentation typo fix to new components development and/or modification of exiting ones. Before you start to contribute we suggest to join the user and development mailing lists.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nTo communicate with the people already involved with EOP to report bugs, suggestions or a personal interest in contributing to the project we provided two different mailing lists:\r\n\r\n- Users: this list is the general users mailing list and is for posting most relevant questions. If you are not sure of which list you should use, post here first. Subscribe by sending an e-mail to: [eop-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:eop-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com)\r\n- Developers: this list is for development discussions like current issues, patch suggestions and to show interest in contributing to the platform. Subscribe by sending an e-mail to:  [eop-dev+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:eop-dev+subscribe@googlegroups.com)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
